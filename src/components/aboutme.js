          A product of George Washington University's Coding Bootcamp, I am a MERN Stack web developer with a history in SQL Reporting as well. In group projects, I specialize in the user experience as well as presentation of the final product. I believe if the product is good, it's worth talking about and worth talking about well.

          The technologies I consider myself adept in include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, Express, React, Mongo, and mySQL.
